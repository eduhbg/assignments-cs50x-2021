# 📂[CS50x 2021](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)
These are my own work for labs and assignments of CS50x 2021 by HarvardX.

You can check all the content about the labs and problems sets [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/weeks/0/).

*All the scripts in the C programming language are made into [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/).*

Hope you enjoy it! 👽
